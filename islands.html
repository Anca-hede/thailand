            <h4>Koh Samui</h4>
            <p>Best island for: an all-rounder Thai island for first-timers, families and honeymooners
                Koh Samui is the tried-and-tested default setting when it comes to Thailand island holidays. It’s a crowd pleaser: an island of latte-coloured beaches, grown-up nightlife, shiny shopping centres, night markets and a giant golden Buddha who gazes peacefully out to sea.</p>

            <img src="images/phuket3.jpg" alt="A picture of Phuket island">
            <h4>Phuket</h4>
            <p>Best island for: partying, uber-cool pool villas and serene nooks
                Thailand’s best known island is also its largest, which means all the more space for rest and play. In loud and neon-lit Patong, you’ll know you’re in Phuket as Thailand’s infamous scenes of drinking and dancing dominates the immediate area. But then you can just as easily shun the tourist throngs and head for the hills – namely the ones with calming ocean views sandwiched between quiet, sandy beaches.</p>

            <img src="images/koh lanta1.jpg" alt="A picture of Koh Lanta island">
            <h4>Koh Lanta</h4>
            <p>Best island for: peaceful bohemian vibes and adults-only holidays
                Serene, friendly and care-free, Koh Lanta is like a Thailand island as discovered by Western backpackers for the first time. It’s actually two islands, one big (Koh Lanta Yai) and one small (Koh Lanta Noi), connected by a bridge.</p>

            <h4>Koh Phangan</h4>
            <p>Best island for: full moon parties and unexpectedly laid-back getaways
                Koh Phangan is mostly famous for its full moon parties, when young travellers flood into Haad Rin every month during the full moon (and half moon) for fluorescent-themed fun. But there’s another rugged side to the island where you can be so far away from the wild celebrations that you’ll forget there’s a party happening at all.</p>

            <img src="images/koh samet1.jpg" alt="A picture of Koh Samet island">
            <h4>Koh Samet</h4>
            <p>Best island for: national park natural beauty and a city-beach combination without flying
                Koh Samet is one of the easiest islands in Thailand to get to but it’s somehow managed to stay under the radar. It’s one of the closest islands to Bangkok, which is why city folk make a beeline to its powder-soft beaches on the weekend. It only takes around four hours by car and speedboat so you can combine the two for a city and beach holiday without the extra flight. </p>

            <h4>Koh Phi Phi</h4>
            <p>Best island for: beach parties and staggering natural beauty – and The Beach
                Koh Phi Phi (pronounced pee-pee) shot to fame when Maya Bay stood in for the secret paradise in Leonardo di Caprio film’s The Beach. It’s true that the once-quiet bay gets jam-packed with tourists intent on seeing the paradise for themselves, but the rest of the archipelago is just as magnificent when it comes to natural attractions.  </p>
